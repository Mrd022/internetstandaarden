        <h2>High Top sneaker</h2>
        <p class="text">The high-top is a shoe that extends slightly over the wearer's ankle. 
            It is commonly used for sports, particularly basketball. 
            It is sometimes confused with the slightly shorter mid-top, which typically extends no higher than the wearer's ankle. 
            High-tops also should not be confused with shorter-length boots such as ankle boots, 
            since high-tops usually refer to athletic shoes, 
            although can also refer to other above-ankle shoes such as some hiking boots. 
            Some dress and casual shoes may also be high-tops. 
            Converse All-Stars, Nike Air Forces 1, 2, and 3, Reebok Freestyle, Reebok BB4600, Nike Air Yeezy and Fila Foggia Hi LTD are examples of high top sneakers. 
            Others include skateboarding sneakers, such as the Vans Vault Hi Fi LX. 
            High-tops are supportive to the wearer's ankles and are useful to those with hypermobility and fallen arches. </p>

            <h2>Mid Top sneaker</h2>
            <p class="text">Mid-top sneakers are a stylish and versatile footwear option that falls somewhere between low-top and high-top sneakers in terms of design and coverage. 
                These sneakers are characterized by their medium-height collar, which typically extends above the ankle but falls short of the full ankle coverage seen in high-top sneakers. 
                Here's a detailed description of mid-top sneakers: Style and Design:
                Mid-top sneakers offer a balanced and trendy look that appeals to a wide range of fashion preferences. 
                Their silhouette combines elements of both low-top and high-top styles, making them suitable for various outfits and occasions.
                Ankle Support:
                The mid-height collar of these sneakers provides a moderate level of ankle support and protection without the bulkiness of high-tops. 
                This feature makes them a comfortable choice for daily wear, casual outings, and light athletic activities.
                Versatility:
                Mid-top sneakers are incredibly versatile, making them a popular choice for both men and women. 
                They can be dressed up or down, making them suitable for a variety of settings, from streetwear to semi-formal occasions. </p>

            <h2>Low Top sneaker</h2>
            <p class="text">Low-top sneakers are a classic and timeless footwear choice known for their sleek, minimalist design and comfort. 
                These sneakers are characterized by their low-cut collar, which sits below the ankle, providing a distinctive look and several practical benefits. 
                Here's a detailed description of low-top sneakers:
                Streamlined Design:
                Low-top sneakers are celebrated for their clean and minimalist appearance. 
                Their simple silhouette, with a low-cut collar and lace-up closure, exudes a sense of understated style that pairs well with a variety of outfits.
                Comfortable Fit:
                The low collar of these sneakers allows for a wide range of ankle motion, making them exceptionally comfortable for all-day wear. 
                The absence of extra ankle support found in mid-top or high-top sneakers adds to the freedom of movement. </p>
